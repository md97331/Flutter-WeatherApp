# Weather App

I've developed "WeatherApp", an application designed to provide weather forecasts for users' favorite locations. This app uses data from the OpenWeatherMap API to display accurate and current weather information.

## Features
* Favorite Locations: Users can select and save their favorite locations. This feature allows for quick and easy access to weather forecasts for the places they care about the most.

* Weather Forecasts: The app displays detailed weather forecasts for the chosen locations. This includes temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more, giving users a comprehensive understanding of the weather conditions.

* Data Persistence: Favorite locations are persisted within the app, ensuring that users don't need to re-enter their preferred locations every time they open the app.

* API Integration: Weather data is retrieved from the OpenWeatherMap API, known for its accuracy and reliability. This ensures that the app provides the most current and precise weather information.

## User Experience
Creating WeatherApp involved integrating API services, managing data persistence, and designing an intuitive user interface. My primary focus was on ensuring the app was both functional and user-friendly.

I implemented a clean and straightforward layout that allows users to easily navigate through their favorite locations and view the weather forecasts. The challenge was to present detailed weather data in a way that was both informative and aesthetically pleasing.
